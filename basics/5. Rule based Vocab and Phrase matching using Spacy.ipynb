The model we built provides initial COVID-19 test screening based on simple clinical signs and symptoms. Improving clinical priorities may lower the burden currently faced by health systems18, by facilitating optimized management of healthcare resources during future waves of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. This is especially important in developing countries with limited resources.\n",
       "\n",
       "This research is not without shortcomings. We relied on the data reported by the Israeli Ministry of Health, which has limitations, biases and missing information regarding some of the features. For example, for patients labeled as having had contact with a person confirmed to have COVID-19, additional information such as the duration and location (indoors/outdoors) of the contact was not available. Some symptoms (such as lack of smell and taste) were identified as being very predictive of a COVID-19 infection by previous studies19, but were not recorded by the Israeli Ministry of Health. We showed that training and testing a model while filtering out symptoms of high bias in advance still achieved very high accuracy. We also note that all the symptoms were self-reported, and a negative value for a symptom might mean that the symptom was not reported. It is therefore important to assess the modelâ€™s performance in the circumstance that more values are unreported or missing rather than with negative values. To simulate a less biased condition, in our prospective test set, we randomly selected negative reports of all five symptoms at a time, and removed the negative values. When applied to these simulated test sets, the model still showed promising results (Fig. 4), thus reinforcing our confidence in the model.\n",
       "\n",
       "While differences in reporting symptoms is a possible limitation of our model, all the persons tested (except for a small minority who were tested under surveys of healthcare workers) had indications for testing13. This implies that there was no referral bias for the vast majority of the subjects in this dataset. The main symptoms in the Israeli Ministry of Health guidelines were cough and fever, and we believe that these symptoms are hard to miss even in those who were negative to SARS"
