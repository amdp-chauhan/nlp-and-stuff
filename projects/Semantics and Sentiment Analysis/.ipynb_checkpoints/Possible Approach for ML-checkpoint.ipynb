      "here's a rarity : a children's film that attempts to tackle a weighty subject , is there a god ? \r\n",

      "unfortunately , it isn't . \r\n",
      "with jumbled messages , and an unclear audience , wide awake was better left asleep . \r\n",

      "his beloved grandfather ( robert loggia ) has died , and joshua has begun a quest . \r\n",
      "he wants to find god , to discover why bad things happen . \r\n",
      "this religious quest is slightly disturbing for his parents ( dana delany and denis leary ) , but they do their best to cope with their son as he explores different religious faiths . \r\n",
      "at his catholic school , his favorite teacher , sister terry ( rosie o'donnell ) , tries to give him guidance , but this is a journey he must make on his own . \r\n",
      "meanwhile , he is having the most momentous year of his life . \r\n",
      "he has several adventures with his daredevil best friend dave ( timothy reifsnyder ) , he gets his first crush , and begins to wake up to the world around him while he is on his spiritual journey . \r\n",
      "it is somewhat confusing as to what the real audience for wide awake is expected to be . \r\n",
      "on its surface , it appears to be a kid's film . \r\n",
      "however , it deals with serious issues , and is likely to be boring for today's instant-gratification kids . \r\n",
      "and while it might seem heartening to see that someone is trying to produce something thoughtful for the kidvid audience , wide awake asks serious questions , but only delivers a cheap gimmick for an answer . \r\n",
      "if there were a bit more meat in the story , adults on a nostalgic bent might get a kick out of the movie . \r\n",
      "the actors who might have created a great cast ( o'donnell , leary and delany ) are wasted in roles that amount to little more than cameos . \r\n",
      "the nostalgic elements ( best friend , favorite teacher , first crush , etc . ) have been done much better in other movies , and actually seem more like filler here . \r\n",
      "the film's strongest scenes are some touching flashbacks depicting joshua's relationship with his grandfather . \r\n",
      "they show more depth than is present anywhere else in the movie . \r\n",
      "maybe the film would have been better if , instead of playing the relationship through flashbacks , it were set entirely during joshua's last year with his grandpa . \r\n",
      "it certainly would have been more entertaining . \r\n",
      "wide awake can best be described as a failed experiment . \r\n",
      "it starts out with noble aspirations , but never delivers on its promise . \r\n",
